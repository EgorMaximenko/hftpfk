This project contains some tests (in Sagemath) of the paper
"Horizontal Fourier transform of the polyanalytic Fock kernel"
by Erick Lee-Guzmán, Egor A. Maximenko, Gerardo Ramos-Vazquez, and Armando Sánchez-Nungaray.

This is an extended and modified copy of the previous project, whose name was too large.
